-- this query extracts worst (highest) Temperature within the first 48hrs of ICU admission:
-- in order to address missing data issues and since some data points were stored incorrectly, we broadened the window since -6 hour from admission.  
-- in case it doesn't find the worst temperature in the first hour either in pivoted_vital or vitalperiodic, it takes the worst temperature per day from apacheapsvar table
-- in those cases we won't be taking the worst temp in the first hour but the worst temp in the first day.
