# Creating de-identified id

# Spliting de-identified data into testing and training, balanced version.

We want the data to be sampled randomly but always the same way and we want to be sure that train and test must be balanced.

```{r}
## set the seed to make our partition reproducible
set.seed(123)
# createDataPartition: "the random sampling is done within the levels of y when y is a factor in an attempt to balance the class distributions within the splits."
## 75% of the sample size
train_idx <- createDataPartition(as.factor(df_me_selected_imputed$aki), times = 1, p = 0.75, list=F)
train <- df_me_selected_imputed[train_idx, ]
test <- df_me_selected_imputed[-train_idx, ]
round(prop.table(table(train$aki)),2)
round(prop.table(table(test$aki)),2)
```

## Exporting datasets

```{r}
write.csv(train,'train.csv',row.names = F)
write.csv(test,'test.csv',row.names = F)
